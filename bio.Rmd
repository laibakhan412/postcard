## Bio

<!--Akim van Eersel studied experimental physics and its associated means of
measurement. After working in industrial instrumentation and research optronics,
he decided to reorient himself in data science. Since the beginning of 2020,
he has been learning independently the associated programming languages,
the workflow from harvesting to data analysis, statistics, linear models and 
machine learning.-->

Akim van Eersel is a materials science engineer with 2 years of experience in 
R&D. Even if he is used to working with data measurements, since 2020 he focused 
and specialized on the complete data science tools and workflow, from harvesting 
to data analysis, statistics, modeling and machine learning.
